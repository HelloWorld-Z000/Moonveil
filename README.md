# Moonveil

I opted for block key + movement input and upon block key release. it will do either horizontal or vertical depending on movement input


equip the amulet and any 1h sword

press and hold block

left and right movement = horizontal slash

forward and backward movement = vertical slash


# Note:

-i don't have a charging animation. black's elden rim animation doesn't include a seperate charging animation. 

-I opted for some random charging animation. also even if I create or found a good match for charging. black's elden rim animation includes the charging part in one hkx. So press block key -> the character will do charging anim -> upon key release -> it play black's anim (charge and then slash). The character will charge 2 timesðŸ¤£ . You can ask black to seperate the charging part and slash part of the animation since he has the blender source.

-true charging mechanics(light attack and power attack charging) in order to be super good needs actor behavior edit. It needs a whole new combat framework from scratch. ABR is a popular one for directional charging mechanic. I opted for something that I can do with scriptðŸ˜³ . scripting is not my forteðŸ˜³ . that's why most of my mods are papyrus script free with the help of SKSE mods like MCO and Payload Interpreter.

-i opted for block key for fake charging
