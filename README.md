AMR - black animation has amr motion data in order for the animation to look good. amr removes sliding and adds attack commitment by properly reading the motion data inside the .hkx. I really think AMR is needed because vanilla always have a fixed motion data so even if you animate a animation moving directionally, the fixed motion data will be applied, . Kingsglaive author also uses AMR in his mod with vanilla combat.
